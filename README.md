# Risk Calculator App

## Description
This repository contains a Risk Calculator App built using Python and PyQt5. The application aims to provide insights into credit risk prediction for Eurozone banks based on climate change data and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

## Features
- Load data from CSV files
- Select a country and year to generate a report
- Calculate credit risk predictions using both deep learning models and Bayesian models
- Display historical data
- Visualize the causal structure model using NetworkX

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- PyMC3
- Scikit-learn
- CausalNex
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- SQLite3

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

4. Run the application:




## Usage
- Upon running the application, you can load your data by clicking on the "Select File" button and choosing a CSV file containing your dataset.
- After loading the data, select a country and year from the respective dropdown menus.
- You can then generate a report by clicking on the "Generate Report" button, which will provide insights into credit risk predictions based on climate change data and TCFD recommendations.
- Additionally, you can view historical data by clicking on the "View History" button.
- To visualize the causal structure model, click on the "Train Model" button.
